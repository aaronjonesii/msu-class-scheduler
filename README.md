# MSU Class Scheduler

MSU Class Scheduler is an Angular web app designed to make MSU course scheduling easier. It features a visual scheduler and is set to include AI-powered semester planning and grade calculation in the future.


## üöÄ Live demo: [msu-class-scheduler.web.app](http://msu-class-scheduler.web.app)


## Key Features (Current and Upcoming)

- Visual Scheduling: Easily visualize your schedule, identify conflicts, and optimize your time
- AI Semester Planner (Future): Intelligent recommendations for optimal course combinations
- Grade Calculator (Future): Calculate your potential overall grade for a course
